**Where do I download the map?**  
Click the most recent world zip from this link `https://github.com/bdamja/Hippo-Practice/releases`.  

**Why isn't the world showing up even though the .zip file is in saves?**  
Because it needs to be extracted (by right-clicking and then extracting) for Minecraft to see it.  

**I extracted it, but it's still now showing up?**  
Make sure all of the files you extracted are inside of a folder, which is in saves. Otherwise, Minecraft won't know that the world exists. 

**Why am I stuck in the cage / why does the map seem broken?**  
This is usually due to you not having your `Render Distance` set to 8. Go to `Options` and then `Video Settings` to configure it.

**How do I get back to spawn?**  
There is a diamond block with a button near the respawn of each map.

**Why can't I see the red numbers on the scoreboard?**  
You have it disabled client side; there should be an option to enable it in your client settings.

**I got stuck, what should I do?**  
If you have a snowball, use that. If you don't, then do `/kill`.
